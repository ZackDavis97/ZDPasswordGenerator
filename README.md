For this homework assignment I was tasked with creating a random password generator. This assignment proved to be challenging because of remembering the command functions and going back and scrutinizing previous code that seemed correct because I misunderstood the function. In the end I was able to successfully create a generator that could spit out passwords between 10-25 characters long.
## Highlights of the assignment
* Line 30-65 was simple in the aspect it was a copy/paste and change the variables to what I needed them to be.
* Each specially defined character was set up for a loop in array.
* I originally had the characters in one continuous string from 11-14, but sparced them out into their own.
* The only alert someone will receive if is if they want a password shorter/greater than the requirements in the prompt.
* A math floor was created so I would be able to get whole numbers.
* The string statements in the js do have some slight variation in the worind to give the experience some character.
